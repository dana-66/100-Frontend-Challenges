#100DaysOfCode
In the spirit of building strong habits and the #100DaysOfCode idea, we decided to make our list of beautifully crafted "Design To Code" challenges publicly available, where each day you work on recreating (with your variation of course!) the original design screenshot to make it a working website/web app.
The goal is to reflect the provided design with HTML & CSS. If you want to dive deeper, adding interactivity via JS or any frameworks, libraries, or tools is more than encouraged.
